# 🇳🇵 Smart NID Nepal — स्मार्ट दर्ता

> 🚧 **Work in Progress / Under Construction** 🚧  
> *This project is currently under active development. Features, UI, and APIs are subject to change.*

**Smart NID Nepal** is an AI-powered National ID (NID) pre-enrollment assistant designed to streamline the complex citizenship registration process in Nepal. 

By leveraging the cutting-edge Google Gemini Vision API, this application completely automates data entry. Users simply upload a photo of their physical Nepali Citizenship Certificate (नागरिकता प्रमाणपत्र), and the AI instantly reads, translates, and extracts all the necessary fields (both in Nepali and English) to pre-fill the official NID enrollment form.

### Key Features:
- **Instant OCR Extraction**: Accurately extracts complex bilingual data (Devanagari and Latin) directly from citizenship cards.
- **Smart Data Conversion**: Automatically converts dates from Bikram Sambat (BS) to Anno Domini (AD).
- **Premium User Interface**: A beautifully crafted, responsive Light Mode UI that feels official and trustworthy.
- **Privacy First**: Built as a secure prototype where image processing happens temporarily in memory—no files or personal data are ever persisted or logged.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your API key

```bash
# In the server directory
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Gemini API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Start both servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Server (port 3001)
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Client (port 5173)
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open in browser

Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
